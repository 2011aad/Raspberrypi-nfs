NFS means network file system

1.install nfs and rpcbind program

#apt-get install nfs-kernal-server
#apt-get install rpcbind

2.configure your nfs

#vim /etc/exports

add following command:

/home/pi	*(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)

------/home/pi is the directory you want to open to others------
------* means any system can mount this directory, you can also use IP address such as 192.168.1.117 to allow specific computer------
------the parameters in () are permissions------

3.start rpcbind and nfs service

#service rpcbind start
#/etc/init.d/nfs-kernal-server restart

Now, nfs server runs in your raspberry pi system!

Turn to your windows PC! 

(before the following steps, make sure nfs is started on your PC)

4.check the shared directory on raspberry pi

#showmount -e 192.168.1.117

5.mount the directory

#mount \\192.168.1.117\home\pi H:

------H: means the mount address------

Then, if you open your windows explorer, you will see H: disk which is the file system on your raspberry pi!
